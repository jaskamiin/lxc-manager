An Ajenti plugin written in Python to manage Linux containers. 

The code was written with handling software instances on a web server in mind, but it works generally all the same.

So far, it works for Debian/Ubuntu - as long as the command `$lxc-list` exists, the code should work.

#/instances/

:  __init__.py
    typical __init__ file, prepares plugin

: lxc.py
    python module with LXC management functions. **Does not require Ajenti to use!**
    
: main.py
    entry point for the plugin.
    
#/instances/layout/

: main.xml
    XML file describing how the plugin should look/what data should be passed.
